     context menu by default.
   * Note: This is applied in `SET_ClassicContextMenu-W11.ps1`.
  2. File Explorer Configuration
   * Show File Extensions: Configures Explorer to always show file extensions (e.g., .txt, .exe) for known file types.

   * Left Align: Aligns the Windows 11 Taskbar icons to the Left (Windows 10 style) instead of the default Center.

Script Variations & Customization--
  1. Proposed Custom Scripts
   * WinAutoSECURE.ps1: A specialized version that enables ALL enhanced security features by default (Maximum Hardening).
   * WinAutoCUSTOM.ps1: A user-generated script created via a 'Script Customizer' tool, allowing granular selection of features.
  2. Optional Features for Customization
   * Dev Drive Protection: Enable 'Performance Mode' for Dev Drives (Async scanning). Ideal for software developers but not enabled by default.
