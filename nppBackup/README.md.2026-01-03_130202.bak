📖 Project OverviewWinAuto is a comprehensive automation suite designed to demonstrate advanced Windows administration and scripting capabilities. Unlike simple "debloat" scripts, WinAuto is engineered as a framework with a focus on reliability, idempotency, and a strictly standardized user experience.It serves as a reference implementation for:Security Posture Management: Automating compliance with Microsoft Security Baselines.System Maintenance: Leveraging native Windows APIs (COM, WMI/CIM) for updates.Modular Architecture: A centralized library design that promotes code reuse.🏗️ Technical Architecture1. Centralized Logic Engine (Shared_UI_Functions.ps1)All scripts inherit their core functionality from a shared kernel to ensure consistency:Visual Standards: Every script invokes Clear-Host immediately upon execution to ensure a clean workspace.Output Spacing: Scripts are engineered to print exactly 5 empty lines at the bottom of their output before exiting to maintain professional CLI separation.Unified UI/UX: A custom ANSI engine renders a consistent, high-contrast interface."The Fuse" Safety: A custom Invoke-AnimatedPause provides an interactive timeout for manual intervention.2. Advanced Automation TechniquesThe suite demonstrates proficiency with deep system interfaces:Windows Update Agent (COM): Directly interfaces with Microsoft.Update.Session for programmatic patching.UI Automation: Uses .NET UIAutomationTypes to drive apps lacking public APIs.Winget Integration: Reliable software deployment via the Windows Package Manager.3. Self-Validating Code (scriptRULES-WinAuto.ps1)The suite includes a CI-style validator that audits the codebase for:Layout Compliance: Verifying scripts start with Clear-Host and end with the mandatory 5-line gap.Encoding: Enforcing UTF-8 with BOM for reliable rendering.Permissions: Verifying #Requires -RunAsAdministrator directives.📂 Repository StructureWinAuto/
